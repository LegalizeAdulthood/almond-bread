Installing AlmondBread

1. Make sure Tcl/Tk and jstools are properly installed.
Knowing the locations of these packages might come in handy.

2. Run "./configure".
This will execute a configuration script generated by GNU
autoconf. You may be prompted for the location of the Tcl/Tk include
files and libraries if configure can't find them in the standard
places. The configure script has some command-line options, which you
can find out about by typing "./configure -help". Not all options are
applicable to AlmondBread, though. The option "--enable-threads"
enables experimental Multithreading support (POSIX 1003.1c threads).

3. Take a look at the Makefile.
Pay particular attention to the settings of "tcldir", which defines
the place where AlmondBread's Tcl files will be installed and
"helpdir", where the jdoc-file will be put.

4. Type "make".

5. Type "make install".

6. You can now run AlmondBread by typing
e.g. "/usr/local/bin/almond". Substitute "/usr/local/bin" with
the directory where the executable "almond" was installed. Be sure
to first check out the on-line help by selecting the "Help" menu in
AlmondBread.

If you ever want to uninstall AlmondBread, type "make uninstall".
Note, that this procedure might leave empty directories, if
AlmondBread was installed in a location where no other programs
reside.

If you encounter problems during the installation of AlmondBread, you
can contact me (after having made a reasonable effort to get it
working by yourself).
